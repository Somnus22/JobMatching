Java Lead GAP Inc - San Francisco, CA July 2014 to August 2016 Project-CAP (Commission Allocation Program)\u00a0 \u00a0 It is a very critical web-based application as this application is visible to external clients along with internal use.\u00a0 Business around this application: CS acts as a broker for institutional client in trading business. There is huge volume trading involved when we are dealing with institutional clients. Hence acting as broker provides huge commission to CS. A deal is finalized between CS and the client on the amount of commission to be owned by CS for execution of each trade done by the client. This commission is split into two parts CS Portion and the client portion (RX (Research exchange/Net commission). CS gives this benefit to the client of giving back some portion of this commission back to the client. This commission is not given back to the client in form of money, but instead CS pays invoices of services used by client from other vendors or vendors provided by CS to the client.\u00a0 Client sends the invoices to CS and CAPS users upload these invoices using the application. The invoices are then accessed by the clients using the CAPS external website (internet application). Clients will be able to see those invoices and accordingly provide a feedback of either paying the invoices, pay it partially or reject the invoices.\u00a0 Based on the feedback provided by the client, CAPS users generate a transmittal request and sends to the PeopleSoft account department for clearing.\u00a0 \u00a0 Responsibilities:\u00a0 \u0095 Developed the project using Agile Methodology.\u00a0 \u0095 Implemented the application using Spring Framework which is based on IOC/Dependency injection design pattern.\u00a0 \u0095 Involved in consuming XML Web Services(SOA) using SOAP, SAX and DOM XML parsers\u00a0 \u0095 Implemented Multithreading and Concurrent API for processing the file and statements.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed shell, Python script, ETL Transformationsand PL/SQL for Control M JOB.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed and deployed REST web service by Jersey to process JSON data\u00a0 \u0095 Developed and implemented UI controls and APIs with Angular JS.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed Perl/python script for batch processing.\u00a0 \u0095 Importing and exporting data in HDFS and Hive using Sqoop.\u00a0 \u0095 Extracted files from Oracle Database through Sqoop and placed in HDFS and processed.\u00a0 \u0095 Written Hive UDFS to extract data from staging tables.\u00a0 \u0095 Provided innovation and automation to save maintenance cost.\u00a0 \u0095 Provides support in extended hours and weekends whenever needed.\u00a0 \u0095 Worked on migration from java 1.6 to 1.8(functional interface, Stream API, Lambda Expressions, Collection and Concurrent API,memory management)\u00a0 \u0095 Worked on integration testing and system testing to test the application functionality.\u00a0 Environment:Eclipse, JDK 1.6, JDK 1.8, JMS, Spring,Angular,WEB LOGIC,Jersey, XML, XSD, ANT, Log4j, Putty, Oracle, SYBASE,Perl/Python, Db2, HADOOP, Jenkins, Visio, UML Eclipse, Soap UI.\u00a0 \u00a0 Project-IMAN/SMAN Globalization\u00a0 ISS supports the settlement of non-US equity transactions that are done at Credit Suisse.

For each new feed, IT is required to analyze the file format and build transformations using custom code to recognize the file format, apply a set of common transformation rules and load the data to an operational data store.This includes new processes for retrieving, parsing, normalizing, and storing client data as well as an interface for CS CSR's to provide greater transparency for internal users.\u00a0 Scope Includes:\u00a0 \u00a0 File Mover - The client can send the allocation and reconciliation information files through various delivery channels like FTP, Email attachments move those files to INFORMATICA DX location for further processing. Before moving file to DX location file goes through various rules like decryption, file name renaming, file size check etc. All these rules configured against client profile.\u00a0 INFORMATICA fetch those files and performs data validation, de-duplication and transformation through various workflows. Once these activities are completed as per record status data will be routed to mentioned destination systems.\u00a0 GUI screens are developed to show Allocation, Clearing and Exception related data to end user.\u00a0 \u00a0 Responsibilities:\u00a0 \u0095 Involved in the design and implementation of the architecture for the project using OOAD, UML Design Patterns.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed the code using Test driven Development.\u00a0 \u0095 Interpreting complicated requirements and implementing them in a user-friendly application that meets the needs of the users.\u00a0 \u0095 Used Struts2 in developing user interfaces using UI Components and interceptors.\u00a0 \u0095 Implemented Multithreading for processing the file.\u00a0 \u0095 Implemented Struts 2 interceptors which are responsible for most of the request and response processing.\u00a0 \u0095 Used Ajax for interactive and dynamic interfaces on web pages.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed PL/SQL code for backend validation and processing.\u00a0 \u0095 Reviewing the code to make sure it follows the best practices and the code.\u00a0 \u0095 Setup of Development Environment and Source Control.\u00a0 \u0095 Tested all the struts2 action using Easy Mock framework.\u00a0 \u0095 Extensively used the JUNIT testing suite for testing and Log4J for logging.\u00a0 \u0095 Involved in Peer Reviews of the code.\u00a0 \u00a0 Environment: Java,JSP,Struts2,Oracle 10g,Informatica,BEA Web logic 10.3, JavaScript,AJAX,XML,ANT, Putty,Rapid SQL,UML Eclipse. Sr. Java Developer Apex Systems, Inc June 2012 to July 2014 Project: Intellect Flow\u00a0 \u00a0 Description: Workflow driven processing is mainly used to draw the BPM process of a product and for Maintenance Process. It provides flexibility to define the entire workflow as per the existing legacy business requirements and allowing the users to automate several intermediate activities which in turn effectively reducing the total business turnover time. Combined with the imaging solution, it provides the users with a powerful Document Management System.\u00a0 Indexer:\u00a0 Helpful for create User defined screen for the maintenance of Transaction and to view the work item details.\u00a0 Imaging:\u00a0 Imaging mainly used for maintaining the transactions data of different products.Generally, the documents are coming through different sources like Scanner, Fax and Email from different location into a main server in the imaging (IMG.TFT) format. After that we are uploading the images by linking to the corresponding transaction's that bank user can easily process the transactions by editing the images.We can also crop, print, zooming, magnify and reject the images according to user choice. To perform the operation, it uses RMI socket connection ISS is used to format SWIFT messages automatically.\u00a0 \u00a0 Responsibilities:\u00a0 \u0095 Responsible for Technical document design depends on the Business flow.\u00a0 \u0095 Responsible for conducting the technical low-level code and design review process and web navigation, control flow and error handling.\u00a0 \u0095 Implemented Multithreading for clearing the instrument.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed web interface using JSP,tag libraries and JavaScript for client-side validations.\u00a0 \u0095 Designed and developed messaging frameworkand integratingwith IBM MQ.\u00a0 \u0095 Handling the build activity for the environment WEBLOGICand WEBSPHERE.\u00a0 \u0095 Worked on integration testing and system testing to test the application functionality.\u00a0 \u0095 Developed new feature and application enhancement for the current iteration.\u00a0 \u0095 Implemented workflow with other different product\u00a0 \u0095 Involved in SQL queries tuning, database design.\u00a0 \u0095 Used the Ant build script to build and deploy the application in UNIX Server.\u00a0 \u0095 Used various UNIX commands for manipulation of directories and files.\u00a0 \u00a0 Environment: Windows/Unix, Java, JavaScript, SERVLET, EJB, JMS, Web Service, Oracle, Weblogic, WebSphere, MQ Series,JSP (JSTL, Custom tags), JDBC, JMS, Ant, JUNIT.
